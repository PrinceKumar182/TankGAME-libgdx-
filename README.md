# Tank Star - Player vs Player Tank Battle Game ðŸŽ®ðŸš€


## Overview  
Tank Star is a Player vs. Player tank battle game where players engage in exciting tank duels. The game features an engaging health and weapons system, with unlimited attack capabilities, constrained by health and fuel. Players must strategize their movements and attacks to outwit their opponent and emerge victorious.  

The project was developed using Java with the LibGDX framework, incorporating Tiled for level design and Scene2D for UI elements and physics-based interactions.
